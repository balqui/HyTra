Project: Slatt
Package: hypergraph - taken almost verbatim from mid 2007 implementation
Programmers: JLB

Purpose: implement hypergraphs, mainly the minimal transversal operation

ToDo:
.testing when hyperedges are actually slanodes
.what happens when slanodes contain things beyond itemsets (trees, seqs...)
.more careful programming of transversal, avoiding duplicate exploration
.try algorithms A and B from Fredman-Khachiyan 
(now it is following blindly the basic strategy there)
