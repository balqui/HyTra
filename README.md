# HyTra
Hypergraph Transversals: a project to study algorithms for computing the minimal transversals of a hypergraph or, equivalently, to dualize monotone Boolean functions. 

Written in standard Python, initially Python 2, later adjusted to be compatible with both Python 2 and 3. Compatibility with Python 2 might be lost in the near future.

This project has no connection whatsoever to the Python-based LISP dialect called Hy. Hypergraphs had their name well established looooong before the birth of that programming language. I personally dislike LISP (who keeps insisting in setting up the parenthesis differently from the vast majority of alive or dead mathematicians and computer scientists).

An earlier version of this software was written mid 2007 as ancillary classes for several exploratory developments on mining closed sets and association rules, of which only https://github.com/balqui/yacaree remains active. This repository is set up with very simmilar versions of the 2007 programs, and its mid-term purpose is to enjoy an independent life as a platform for testing and evaluating the efficiency of hypergraph transversal algorithms, of which there are several out there by now. However, it starts rather simple implementations both of the hypergraphs and of the transversal computation.
